You must form a clear and definite mental picture of what you want. Spend leisure hours in contemplating your vision.
Every day, hold the picture on your thoughts with a fixed purpose to realize it. Behind this purpose must be an invincible and unwavering FAITH that the thing is already yours!
Give thanks, every day, for what you have. Also, be thankful for the thing you want like you already have them!
The way to create riches is through trade and commerce. When things reach you, they will be in the hands of other men, who will ask an equivalent for them. And you can only get what is yours by giving the other man what is his.
Give to every man more than you take from him. Give more value than what your customer pays you in cash value. That way everybody gets richer.
Fill your current place. Expand as much as you can enriching everybody you come in contact with.
Do not wait for a change of environment, before you act; get a change of environment by action. Act now. You can advance only by being larger than your present place. Do, with faith and purpose, all that can be done each day, doing each separate thing in an efficient manner. It is really not the number of things you do, but the EFFICIENCY of each separate action that counts. Go as fast as you can, but never hurry.
